1 - Name your file \texttt{filename} (ideally \texttt{01\_filename})\\
2 - Take a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change
(day, hour or minutes).\\
3 - Update your entire working folder to the cloud.

\textbf{Pros:} Error proof, seamless documentation, one file per
document, track differences across all versions, meant to work with the
cloud.

\textbf{Cons:} Harder adoption.
